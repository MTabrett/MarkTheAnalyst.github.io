									<p style="text-align: left;">The HR team at “Atlas Labs” follows the Kimball Model to monitor employee metrics 
										and understand attrition factors. We used a snowflake schema with a central fact table storing Performance 
										Ratings and five dimension tables (Employee, EducationLevel, RatingLevel, SatisfiedLevel, and Date). The 
										“Overview” tab included measures like TotalEmployees, ActiveEmployees, and InactiveEmployees, allowing 
										us to calculate the % Attrition Rate. Our analysis focuses on diversity (age, gender, marital status, 
										ethnicity) and its impact on employee numbers and average salary. Notably, white employees receive the 
										highest average salary, while non-binary individuals constitute 8.5% of the workforce. By understanding 
										these demographics, we aimed to help Atlas Labs promote diversity and equitable opportunities. They also monitor 
										individual performance ratings and satisfaction to enhance employee retention.</p>

									<p>In the initial stage, we define a list of possible words for the game. From this list, a random word is selected as the 
										secret word. The player is then prompted to input a letter. To ensure valid input, the program checks that the guess 
										is a single character. Throughout this process, proper documentation is maintained, and the code is optimized. Regular 
										commits and pushes to a GitHub repository help track progress. The second stage focuses on validating the players input. 
										We iteratively check whether the input is a valid guess. Additionally, the program verifies whether the guessed letter 
										is part of the randomly selected secret word. To facilitate these checks, we create functions that handle input 
										validation and word comparison. This stage ensures that the game operates smoothly and prevents incorrect or invalid 
										guesses. To enhance code organization and maintainability, we transition to an object-oriented paradigm. We create 
										two classes: Game and Hangman. The Game class initializes essential attributes, including the random word, the word 
										guessed so far, the number of letters in the word, the remaining lives, the word list, and the list of guessed letters. 
										The Hangman class defines methods for checking input validity and determining the outcome based on whether the guessed 
										letter is part of the secret word. This paradigm shift improves code readability and scalability. In the final stage, 
										we assemble all components. A function called play_game orchestrates the entire Hangman game. It combines the word 
										selection, input validation, and outcome determination. With this function, players can interact with the game 
										seamlessly. By following these stages, developers create an engaging and interactive Hangman experience that 
										challenges players to guess the secret word while avoiding the hangmans fate.</p>

									<p>The company has received multiple product orders and created a summary table capturing Order ID, Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Quantity, and 
										Sales Amount. This detailed analysis aims to provide granular insights for the Head of Sales. Managing direct expenses efficiently is 
										crucial, and the company investigates gross profit by subtracting the cost of goods sold from total sales revenue. The goal is to 
										maintain low production costs for a healthy bottom line. Visualizing trends between sales revenue and manufacturing costs using scatter 
										plots is essential.

										The product manager seeks insights into product performance within the catalog. This analysis informs marketing strategies, guides 
										investments in new products, and enhances customer communications. Specifically, the evaluation focuses on female products sold to 
										supermarket retailers in 2021. The team compares sales amounts and enhances bar charts using Power BI’s Analytics pane to evoke an 
										emotional response from the audience. Additionally, they explore product performance across different retailer channels, emphasizing 
										total order quantities. Stacked bar charts categorize items ordered by channel and product type, while small multiples allow comparisons 
										across Franchise outlets for Hoodies & Sweatshirts, considering product colors and gender types.
										
										The company tracks critical financial indicators: total sales amount (revenue), total cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross profit. 
										Visualizations using line and area charts reveal trends over time. While gross profit is essential, it doesn’t always correlate 
										directly with profit margin. The Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) emphasizes clear communication of insights, especially regarding the 
										need for total sales to consistently exceed costs across all products.
										
										The company also investigates gross profit margin, aiming for a 70% target set by the executive team. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
										help track overall performance, and the CCO focuses on comparing Total Orders and Total Returns to minimize returns.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/MTabrett/dice_odds-floor_60">What are the chances of winning a bet, game of dice.<br />
										</a></h2>

									<p>Imagine standing at the base of this architectural marvel (Empire State building), ready to embark on a thrilling adventure with a friend. The rules are simple: you will 
										roll a dice 100 times, and each roll determines your fate. The dice is rolled and if a 1 or 2 thrown then descend one step, if 3, 4 or 5 thrown 
										then ascend one step, if lucky enough to throw a 6 then throw dice again and ascend that number of steps. A max function was used to stop going below the ground floor. The 
										next thing was to stop the accumulative score to go below zero (ground floor) which we did by incorporating a max() function. Beware! There is a 0.1% or 0.5% chance of 
										a treacherous fall down the stairs, forcing you to start anew from the ground floor.
										We have made a bet to reach the 60th step after 100 throws. What are the odds of achieving this? We simulated the process 10k times. Using NumPys rand function we generated 
										die numbers (utilising a fixed seed to enable reproducibility). Each complete simulation represents one journey up the building, tracking the accumulative steps. Then we used 
										MatPlotLib to visual the random walks. to determine the odds we analysed the distribution of final step values from each simulation, displaying this on a Histogram. With the 
										jeopardy of complete crash to bottom. With a 5% jeopardy the chances of reaching 60 steps are 57.13% and if 1% jeopardy your chances rise to 77.63%.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mark.tabrett/viz/WorldEconomics_16992657875430/GlobalIndicators">Data Exploration in Tableau<br />
										</a></h2>
									<p>We created a world map depicting global population with the size of each countries population depicted by circle size. The birth rate was depicted 
											by colour with red being above 3%. The visualisation serves to represent global demographic and health-related statistics. </p>

									<p>We then presented a bar chart of countries GDP per Capita to enable comparison with others. The data provides an important discovery that USA has 
										significant higher Expenditure as %GDP and per capita. This questions healthcare efficiency and policy issues which need discussing. There are 
										only 4 countires above the health expenditure threshold of 14%. The next factor that indicated global growth and development was to investigate 
										mobile phone and internet usage. This was plotted on a combo chart and demonstrates that mobile phone grows much faster than internet in 3rd 
										world countries. The next insight found was that following negative economic growth a corresponding decline in interest rates occurred. Then 
										we investigated the impact of international tourism and has that changed over 2001-2012. UK spends more on international tourism than we make as 
										income. Businesses are more successful and find ease when the country has high GDP levels.</p>

										The decision was made to track Carries, tackles, lineouts won during a game (average). Then displaying how many mins each player played and over
